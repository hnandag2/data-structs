//
//  ThreadSafeQueueFineGrained.h
//
//  fine grained thread-safe queue that implements the queue as a linked list
//  with head and tail pointers.
//  i) start with a dummy head/tail, after 1 push the head points to the new value
//  and tail points to the dummy node
//  ii) thread locking is fine grained to only protecting access to the head and
//  tail nodes and even further only protect the pointer swapping (ie: not the allocations
//  /writing of value, etc.
//  iii) this implementation is more serializable (ie: threads can push and pop at
//  the same time, 2 or more pushing threads can allocate memory concurrently, 2
//  popping threads can deallocate memory/write result concurrently
