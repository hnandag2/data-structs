//
//  LockFreeStack
//
//  A simple lock-free stack that garbage collects popped nodes. Garbage
//  collection is triggered by a pop(). All leaked nodes are guaranteed
//  to be garbage collected at the last pop()- since the last pop() will
//  be by a single thread.
//
//  Note: compare_exchange_weak() is used to ensure single instruction CAS
//  on platforms that do not always guarantee single instruction CAS.
//
//  Design is based off the tutorial in Anthony Williams' C++ Concurrency In Action
//  book (Chapter 7).- https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/c-concurrency-in/9781933988771/
